Version 1.0.2 (/17-05.24)
- Remove automatic zoom

Version 1.0.1 (16.05.24)
- Use QgsNetworkManager for getCoverage request

Version 1.0.0 (28.03.24)

- Enable subsetting in other crs than the the native one of a coverage:
    - Axislabels of other crs are retrieved using the proj.db
    - If it is not possible to find the axis labels, the native crs is used instead
    - Currently only 2 axis are supported
    - Gui contains now 2 crs dropdowns (output crs and subset crs)

- Increase usability: Include a bounding box that shows the extent of the coverage:
    - Bounding box adjusts if the crs of the project changes
    - On selceting a coverage, the map view zooms to the bounding box.

- Increase the usability of chosing a subset extent:
    - Include a polygon mode to draw a request extent (Polygon bounding box is deleted if the crs of the project is changed)
    - Show the map crs to the user in the plugin gui (Extent is given in map coordinates, best results are given if subset crs and map crs are equal)
    - Make it possibe to deactivate subsetting (useful for small coverages)

- Adjust Get Coverage Tab to the selected coverage:
	- For each coverage the native crs is read from describeCoverage
    and added to both dropdwons: output crs and subset crs

- Add layouts to the plugin gui:
    - The size of the content is adjusted to the size of the gui

- Warnings and error handling:
    - Reduce number of possible python errors while the plugin is running:
        - Check the reponses from the server and prevent errors reading the xml
        - Raise errors if substantial information is missing
    - Include a message bar in the plugin gui: shows warning and errors related to the plugin
    - Include dynamic gui elements: block tabs and buttons, as long as user input is missing

- Include QgsNetworkManager:
    - GetCapabilities/DeescribeCoverage request: Native qgis support for wcs requests can be used (logs, F12 console,...)

- Include a plugin reset on ESC key (remove bounding boxes)
